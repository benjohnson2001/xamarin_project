To run the program, enter the following at the command line of the program directory: bash run.sh

dependencies

-wget
-lynx
-firefox


known issues

- The program does not check if the actor has died, therefore actors present in the film through archival footage will report inflated ages

- Les Misérables does not display properly in the output due to the é character

- Some movies display no ages listed even when there are, this because start or end strings surrounding the cast list are sometimes not present due to inconsistent imdb formatting
