------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the program, enter the following at the command line of the program directory: ./run.sh

dependencies

-wget
-lynx
-firefox


known issues

- The program does not check if the actor has died, therefore actors present in the film through archival footage will report inflated ages

- Les Mis√©rables does not display properly in the output

- Some movies display no ages listed even when there are, this is due to the start or end strings surrounding the cast list not being present due to inconsistent imdb formatting
